## Youâ€™d want to find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day:
## The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.
## Find a way to deal with missing values, if any.
## Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations
## Now, try another direction. For the 3 most commonly occurring violation codes, find the most common times of day (in terms of the bins from the previous part)

## Lets check missing values
